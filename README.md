# Zenable Skills

Zenable enforces your organization's coding standards — the requirements your
team decided on — against the code AI agents write, as they write it. Teams
adopt AI coding agents at full speed and stay audit-ready, and developers keep
whatever IDE or agent they already use.

You describe a standard once as a plain-English requirement. Zenable enforces it
with a mix of deterministic static analysis and AI review, and records every
finding — a durable account of what was actually checked, not a claim that an
agent looked.

This repository is the home for Zenable's developer-side integrations: the agent
plugin — which ships as both a Claude Code plugin and a portable
[Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/) package — plus a pre-commit hook
and drop-in configuration for plenty of different agentic IDEs.
Your requirements travel with you across all of them.

## How it works

You describe a standard once in plain English; Zenable turns it into automated
verifier rules — a mix of deterministic static analysis and AI review — that enforce
it everywhere your code moves: in the editor as your agent writes, and again in
pre-commit and CI. The payoff:

- **Adopt AI at full speed, stay audit-ready** — every finding is recorded on
  the exact file and line and attributed to the requirement behind it: the
  evidence an audit asks for, not a claim that an agent looked.
- **Fixed in the same turn** — violations feed straight back to the coding agent
  as it works, so they're resolved before they land.
- **No cost, no friction** — deterministic checks are pre-fetched and run
  locally, adding effectively no wall-clock time and no inference cost, with no
  change to the IDE or agent your developers already use.

Over time Zenable learns from the signals your team already produces — fixes, PR
activity, agent and human feedback, false positives — and proposes improvements
to the requirements and verifier rules themselves. Those proposals are governed by
policies you set, with a human kept in the loop wherever you require one.

## Integrations

Each integration below is a self-contained setup. Pick the ones that match your
workflow — they layer cleanly (in-editor + pre-commit + CI is a common combo)
and enforce the same requirements no matter which you use, with nothing to
reconfigure when your team adopts a new tool.

### Claude Code plugin

Install the plugin from this repo's marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Zenable-io/skills
/plugin install z@zenable
```

**Team setup** — commit this to `.claude/settings.json` so everyone gets it:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "zenable": {
      "source": {"source": "github", "repo": "Zenable-io/skills"}
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {"z@zenable": true}
}
```

On first session the plugin sets itself up — it installs the `zenable` CLI and
wires the post-edit hooks for you, so verifier rule review starts running on every
edit with nothing else to configure. What you get:

- **Hooks** — automatic verifier rule review after each file edit. Violations are
  returned to the agent to fix in place.
- **Skills** — twelve of them, all invocable as `/z:<name>`. **`/z:review`**
  for autonomous, requirement-aware code review; **`/z:setup`** to onboard a
  codebase by turning the standards you've already written down into scoped
  Zenable requirements; **`/z:assessment`** to run a full assessment on top of
  those requirements and produce a deliverable report; **`/z:triage`** to address
  unresolved Zenable review comments on the current PR/MR; **`/z:pr-metrics`**
  to render your organization's PR delivery history before and after Zenable
  as a local report; plus `/z:feat`,
  `/z:debug`, `/z:addtests`, `/z:doublecheck`, `/z:rebase`, `/z:prfeedback`, and
  `/z:researchbranch`.
- **CLI** — the local engine behind the hooks and skills, running deterministic,
  token-free verifier rule checks.
- **MCP** — full platform access for your agent: your requirements, verifier rules,
  and findings, agent observability, how your requirements and verifier rules
  improve over time, and configuring the platform itself. Connect it with one
  command:

  ```bash
  zenable install mcp claude-code
  ```

### Agent Plugins

The same package is also a portable
[Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) plugin, so clients
that implement the spec load the identical twelve skills with no Zenable-specific
glue. Install it through the client's own plugin flow, adding
`Zenable-io/skills` as a marketplace and then installing `z@zenable`.

### Skills CLI

To drop just the skills into any agent the
[`skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) supports — Claude Code,
Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and dozens more — point it at this repo:

```bash
npx skills add Zenable-io/skills                    # pick skills and agents interactively
npx skills add Zenable-io/skills --skill triage     # install one skill
npx skills add Zenable-io/skills --list             # see what's available
```

Skills installed this way are invoked by their bare name (`/triage` rather than
`/z:triage`) and don't include the plugin's post-edit hooks — use the plugin, or
`zenable install`, for automatic review on every edit.

### Other AI editors

The same guardrails — remote MCP plus an automatic post-edit review — work
across Cursor, VS Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, and many more. Install the
Zenable CLI, then let it write each editor's config:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.zenable.app/install.sh | bash

zenable install cursor      # or: codex, vscode, copilot, amp, auggie,
zenable install codex        # antigravity, kiro, goose, devin-desktop, …
zenable install              # auto-detect every installed editor
```

The CLI writes the MCP server config — handling the required out-of-band login —
and, where the editor supports it, the post-edit hook into that editor's own
config files. Add `--project` to scope it to the current repo or `--dry-run` to
preview. Run `zenable install --help` for the full list of supported editors.

### Pre-commit

Catch violations before they're committed. Install the Zenable CLI first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.zenable.app/install.sh | bash
```

Then add the hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Zenable-io/skills
    rev: v3 # Consider `pre-commit autoupdate --freeze` to safely lock and maintain this
    hooks:
      - id: zenable-check
```
