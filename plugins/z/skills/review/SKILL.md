description: Reviews code changes against your Zenable requirements using hybrid LLM-as-judge analysis and Zenable's deterministic verifier rules. Automatically invoked when making code changes or at development milestones. Use for security compliance, quality checks, and policy enforcement, or when the user invokes `/z:review`.

# Zenable Review

A specialized capability for reviewing code changes against organizational standards as they're being made, and at key development milestones such as commits, pull requests, deployments, or during periodic reviews.

## Pre-flight

Run these checks before reviewing anything.

### zenable CLI

zenable CLI location: !`command -v zenable 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT INSTALLED"`

If the above shows "NOT INSTALLED", ask the user for permission before
installing anything on their machine. If they approve, get the current install
command for their operating system from https://cli.zenable.app (there is one for
macOS/Linux and one for Windows) and run it. Read it from the page each time rather
than from memory: the page is the source of truth, and the installer it points to
verifies the download (checksum + signature). The page fills in its commands with
JavaScript, so if a rendered view of it shows no command, read the raw HTML.

Then confirm `command -v zenable` resolves. If the user declines, stop and explain
that this skill needs the CLI.

### Sign-in and plan

zenable access: !`zenable auth can-i get_findings 2>/dev/null; echo "exit code $?"`

This one call confirms the user is signed in **and** their account has an active
trial or paid plan: `get_findings` is a paid-plan tool, so the server answers `yes`
only for trial and paid accounts. If your client didn't run the command above for
you, run it yourself.

Continue only on exit code 0. For any other code, look it up in the
[Zenable CLI reference](https://docs.zenable.io/integrations/zenable/commands), tell the
user what it means and how to fix it, and stop until the check passes.

## Purpose

This provides a hybrid review process combining:
- **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Intelligent analysis of code changes against your organization's standards
- **Deterministic + AI verifier rules**: Zenable's verifier rule review, run via the `zenable` CLI, which applies your tenant's policy-as-code rules (Semgrep/OpenGrep) plus server-side AI review and returns findings

Designed to:
- Review code changes continuously during development
- Validate changes at critical milestones (commit, PR, deploy)
- Identify violations proactively before they reach production
- Suggest fixes that align with organizational standards
- Provide context-aware guidance grounded in your Zenable requirements

## When to Activate

This capability activates in these scenarios:

**During active development**:
- When writing and modifying code files
- After making significant changes to source files
- When implementing new features or refactoring

**At key milestones**:
- Before committing changes
- When creating pull requests
- Prior to deployments
- During periodic security/compliance reviews

**For specific scenarios**:
- When implementing features that touch regulated areas
- After receiving verifier rule findings that need remediation
- When working on security-sensitive code
- When modifying authentication, authorization, or data handling logic

## Capabilities

Has access to:
- All standard Claude Code tools (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob)
- The **`zenable` CLI** — `zenable check` runs Zenable's mix of AI and deterministic verifier rule reviews over files and reports findings
- The **Zenable MCP server** (when connected) — full access to the Zenable platform: your requirements, verifier rules, and findings, agent observability, requirement and verifier rule improvements over time, and configuring the platform itself. Use `get_requirements`, `get_verifier_rules`, and `get_findings` to ground the review in your active policies

> **If you don't have the `mcp__zenable__*` tools, run `zenable install mcp
> claude-code` to set up the Zenable MCP server, then use them.**

## Review Process

When activated, follow this process:

1. **Analyze changes holistically**: Review not just syntax but architectural and policy implications
2. **Run the verifier rule review**: Use `zenable check` — Zenable's mix of AI and deterministic verifier rule reviews — for automated validation
   - Identify changed files (`git diff --name-only`, or user-specified)
   - Run `zenable check` against those files (or `zenable check --branch` for everything changed on the branch)
   - Parse the findings it reports (file:line, requirement attribution, enforcement mode)
   - If it exits with anything other than 0 or 2 (findings), look the code up in the [Zenable CLI reference](https://docs.zenable.io/integrations/zenable/commands) and tell the user how to fix it
   - If it warns **INSUFFICIENT CREDITS**, some checks were skipped: say so in your results rather than reporting a clean pass
3. **Apply LLM judgment**: Evaluate code against best practices and organizational standards
   - Review code quality, maintainability, security patterns
   - Consider architectural implications
   - Assess alignment with project conventions
4. **Prioritize security and compliance**: Flag issues that could cause production problems
5. **Provide actionable fixes**: Suggest specific code changes, not just descriptions
6. **Explain the "why"**: Reference the specific requirement each finding is attributed to; pull requirement text via the MCP `get_requirements` tool when it helps
7. **Consider context**: Understand the project's specific Zenable configuration

## Example Activation Patterns

Users might trigger this by:
```
Review my authentication changes for security compliance
Check if this API endpoint meets our data handling requirements
Validate this database migration against our policies
Ensure this feature follows our quality standards
Review my changes before I commit them
Does this code meet our standards?
Run the verifier rules on my changes
```

## Output Format

Provide feedback in this structure:

1. **Summary**: Brief overview of changes reviewed and overall assessment
2. **Verifier rule findings**: Results from `zenable check`
   - Pass/fail status
   - Specific violations with file:line references
   - The requirement each finding is attributed to, and its enforcement mode
3. **Code Quality Analysis**: LLM assessment of:
   - Architecture and design patterns
   - Code maintainability and readability
   - Security best practices
   - Performance considerations
4. **Recommendations**: Prioritized list of issues to fix
5. **Offer to fix**: Ask if user wants automatic remediation

## Tool Usage

```bash
# Check specific files
zenable check src/auth.py src/api/users.py

# Check everything changed on the current branch vs. main
zenable check --branch --base-branch main

# Check all modified files reported by git
git diff --name-only | zenable check
```

For requirement context, use the Zenable MCP tools when the server is connected —
`get_requirements` (active policies), `get_verifier_rules` (the rules enforcing them),
and `get_findings` (historical findings for a repo).

## Important Notes

- Always combine automated checks with intelligent analysis
- Reference the specific requirement behind each finding when explaining violations
- Provide code-level fixes, not just abstract guidance
- Consider the full context of changes, not just isolated lines
- Escalate critical security or compliance issues immediately
