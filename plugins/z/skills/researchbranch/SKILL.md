# Research the current branch

Take a look at the current branch, and do your research, see which files have changes
between this branch and the main branch (typically `main` or `master`), and what the
diffs are. Read the entire file contents as you feel it is necessary to get additional
context.

Review the corresponding pull request on GitHub, if there is one, using
`gh pr view --json number -q .number`.

Your goal is to identify what the intent of the developer is with this branch, and what
the current state is (as in, has it been peer reviewed, are there unresolved comments,
etc). ultrathink and summarize the intent, current state, rationale, outstanding work to
be done.

If the branch adds or changes a status field, a set of booleans, or timestamps that
together mean a state, list the states, what writes each transition, and what rejects an
illegal one. Stay inside what the branch touched, and count an illegal transition nothing
rejects as outstanding work.

If the user narrowed the scope when invoking this skill, focus the summary accordingly.
