"""Validate the plugin as both a Claude Code plugin and an Agent Plugins 1.0 package.

`plugins/z` ships in two formats from one directory:

- Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, and `hooks/hooks.json`.
- Agent Plugins 1.0 clients read the root `plugin.json` and `skills/`. They ignore
  component types they do not support, so `hooks/` and `.claude-plugin/` are inert
  to them.

A client that supports both formats prefers the *portable* manifest, not the
client-specific one: codex-cli 0.147.0 reads the root `plugin.json` and refuses to
install unless its `name` equals the marketplace entry name, failing with

    plugin.json name `zenable` does not match marketplace plugin name `z`

That rule is enforced in `check_marketplaces` below, and it is why both manifests and
both catalogs agree on the name `z`. Because the root manifest is the one that wins,
drift there is invisible rather than merely cosmetic, so every shared field -- `name`
included -- is compared between the two manifests.
